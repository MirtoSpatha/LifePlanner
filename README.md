# LifePlanner

In this project we created a Desktop App to help a user virtually manage his home and daily schedule with the aid of a smart assistant. Our goal was to simulate the functionality of a smart home, but not make the application feasible in the real world.

The user can take the following actions:
## 1. Save his personal information and preferences
When entering the application for the first time, the user is asked to fill in a form with his name, age, gender, home address, work address, means of transport, shoe size, favorite beverage and pet. This information is later used by the smart assistant to facilitate functions like user's transportation, choice of shoes and food for the pet.
## 2. Navigate to his smart home
The user can see all the rooms of the home using the graphical interface or the menu on the upper left corner of the screen. 
## 3. Create his Daily Schedule

## 4. Use the smart Shoecabinet to choose the appropriate shoes for the day
## 5. Control the smart devices of the house
## 6. Configure the automatic feeder for his pet
